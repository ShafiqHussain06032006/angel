# Summary: Plan 03-01 — Security Persona in Debate (8th Agent)

## What Was Built
Added a Security Engineer as the 8th agent in the DebateOrchestrator, shifting security left to the PRD stage.
Compliance scanning (GDPR/HIPAA) and OWASP baseline are now automatically injected into every generated PRD.

## Tasks Completed

### Step 1 — 8th Security Agent
- [x] `DEBATE_AGENTS` array extended with security persona:
  > `{ id: 'security', role: 'Security Engineer (OWASP Top 10, auth design, data classification, GDPR/HIPAA, secret management, threat modeling)' }`
- [x] Security agent gets hardened `buildPrompt` with 5 mandatory questions probing: attack vectors, PII/PHI classification, auth/authz model, insecure defaults, and STRIDE threat model

### Step 2 — PRD Security Section
- [x] PRD generation prompt updated with 8-section schema including mandatory **Security & Compliance** section
- [x] Security section instructs LLM to include: OWASP Top 10 checklist, data classification, GDPR consent, HIPAA controls, threat model summary, required security controls

### Step 3 — GDPR/HIPAA Compliance Detector
- [x] `detectComplianceFlags()` implemented — scans all PRD section content for:
  - 14 GDPR keywords (email, name, address, phone, location, consent, analytics, ...)
  - 12 HIPAA keywords (health, medical, diagnosis, patient, prescription, clinical, ...)
- [x] Flags appended to `PRDSection.complianceFlags[]` with actionable remediation text
- [x] `injectOwaspChecklist()` appends 6 OWASP baseline controls to any section without explicit OWASP content

### Step 4 — PRDSection Type Extension
- [x] `complianceFlags?: string[]` added to `PRDSection` interface in `src/types/sdlc.ts`
- [x] Backward compatible — existing code unaffected

### Step 5 — Compliance Badges UI
- [x] New CSS classes: `.flag-badge`, `.flag-gdpr` (blue), `.flag-hipaa` (red), `.flag-owasp` (orange), `.security-section` (orange left border)
- [x] `renderPRD()` now renders `complianceFlags` as colored warning blocks under each PRD section
- [x] `appendDebateMsg()` renders Security agent in red with 🔐 icon, highlighted background
- [x] PRD Security & Compliance section gets orange left-border accent
- [x] `writePRDToFile()` migrated to `AngelArtifactService`; writes both `PRD.md` and `prd.json`

## Verification
- [x] TypeScript compile: 0 errors
- [x] Security agent appears in debate transcript with red 🔐 badge
- [x] Topic containing "email" or "profile" → GDPR flag in PRD
- [x] Topic containing "health" or "patient" → HIPAA flag in PRD
- [x] Security & Compliance section always present in generated PRD
- [x] `PRDSection.complianceFlags` field doesn't break existing SDLCWebviewPanel state handling
