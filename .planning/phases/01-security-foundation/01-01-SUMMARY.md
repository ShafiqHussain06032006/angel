# Summary: Plan 01-01 — Secure API Key Storage

## What Was Built
Migrated all API key handling from plaintext VSCode settings and `showInputBox` prompts to VSCode `SecretStorage` (OS-level encrypted keychain).

## Tasks Completed
- [x] `ConfigService` extended with `setSecretStorage()`, `getApiKey()`, `storeApiKey()`, `deleteApiKey()`, and `detectProvider()` methods
- [x] `extension.ts` wired `context.secrets` into configService on activation
- [x] `processUserInput()` now reads from SecretStorage first; prompts only on first use, then auto-stores
- [x] `voiceConversationComplete` command reads from SecretStorage the same way
- [x] `angel.clearApiKeys` command added — multi-select QuickPick to clear keys per provider
- [x] `package.json`: version bumped to `0.2.0`, `displayName` and `description` updated, plaintext `anthropicApiKey`/`groqApiKey` settings removed, replaced with `defaultProvider` enum
- [x] `angel.startSDLC` and `angel.clearApiKeys` registered in `contributes.commands`

## Self-Check: PASSED
- TypeScript compile: 0 errors
- API keys no longer visible in `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration()` or settings.json
- First call prompts; subsequent calls resolve from keychain silently
