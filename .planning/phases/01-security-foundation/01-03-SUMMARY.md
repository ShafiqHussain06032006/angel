# Summary: Plan 01-03 — Logger Polish & Artifact Path Isolation

## What Was Built
Upgraded logger with structured level filtering, and introduced `AngelArtifactService` to centralize all `.angel/` artifact I/O.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] `Logger` upgraded: level filtering (`DEBUG` suppressed in production, enabled in dev mode), padded level column, full stack trace formatting on errors, `LogLevel` type export
- [x] `logger.show()` removed from auto-invocation on startup — output channel is passive; user can show via `Angel: Show Angel Output`
- [x] `AngelArtifactService` created: `getPath()`, `read()`, `readJSON()`, `write()`, `writeJSON()`, `exists()`, `delete()`, `list()` — single service for all `.angel/` file I/O
- [x] `SDLCWebviewPanel` migrated: `saveState()`, `loadState()`, `decomposePRD()` now use `AngelArtifactService` instead of ad-hoc `fs.writeFileSync` calls
- [x] `tasks.json` also written alongside `tasks.md` for structured downstream consumption

## Self-Check: PASSED
- TypeScript compile: 0 errors
- No direct `fs.writeFileSync` to workspace root in SDLCWebviewPanel
- Logger emits timestamps and padded level labels
