# 14-02: Final Docs + VSIX Package — Summary

## Completed Work

1. **README.md Rewrite**
   - Full rewrite with Mermaid architecture diagram showing User Interface → Router → Conversational/SDLC paths → BMAD Agents → LLM Providers → Cross-cutting Services.
   - 9-Phase SDLC Pipeline table mapping each phase to agents and outputs.
   - Key Features section covering all 14 implemented phases.
   - Configuration table for all `angel.*` settings.
   - Commands table documenting all 17 commands with keyboard shortcuts.
   - Installation instructions (from VSIX and from source).
   - Release notes for 1.0.0.

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Created with prerequisites, setup, development, testing, PR process, and code style sections.
   - Documents `MockLLMProvider` usage for test writing.
   - Full project structure reference.

3. **Version Bump to 1.0.0**
   - `package.json` version: `"1.0.0"`.
   - Added `repository` field for GitHub link resolution.

4. **VSIX Package**
   - `vsce package` produced `angel-1.0.0.vsix` (13.72 MB, 856 files).
   - Created `.vscodeignore` to exclude `.agent/`, `.planning/`, `src/`, `tests/`, etc. for slimmer future builds.

## Verification
- `npm run compile` — zero errors.
- `vsce package` — exit code 0, produced `angel-1.0.0.vsix`.
