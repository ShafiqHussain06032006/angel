# 13-02: Angel CI Pipeline - Summary

## Completed Work
1. **GitHub Actions Scaffolded**
   - Configured `.github/workflows/ci.yml` specifically adapted for VS Code integration scenarios utilizing the VS Code test-electron environment.
   - Enforced target versions for latest `node` footprints spanning across 18.x and 20.x configurations seamlessly.
2. **Comprehensive Step Implementation**
   - Handled standard operational lifecycles (`npm ci`, `compile`) preventing broken build submissions.
   - Established specific rules binding xvfb framebuffers solely when matching Linux platform parameters contextually (`xvfb-run -a npm run test`).
   - Prepared `vsce package` rules sequentially bundled into `upload-artifact` steps to automatically synthesize `VSIX` deployment payloads whenever operations run on clean Node 20.x hosts.

## Results
- Real-time CI/CD defense mechanism fully codified per requirements, securing PR validation channels on subsequent branches.
