# Phase 8: CI/CD & GitHub Integration (SDLC Phase 6) - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Detect the user's GitHub repo and auto-scaffold GitHub Actions workflows, Dockerfiles, and Kubernetes manifests for generated applications/services within their workspace.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### GitHub Action Workflow Complexity
- **D-01:** Full CI/CD Pipeline.
- **D-02:** Include steps for Lint, Test, Build, Docker Build/Push, and Release generation (user will configure secrets manually later).

### Container & K8s Strategy
- **D-03:** Docker + Helm Chart.
- **D-04:** Generate comprehensive multi-stage Dockerfiles and full Helm chart templates for Kubernetes deployments rather than simple manifests.

### Automated PR Approach
- **D-05:** Direct Commit & Push.
- **D-06:** Angel will commit the generated scaffolding files directly to the current working branch (no branch switching or Draft PRs).

### Discretion
- Exact naming and organization of Helm chart templates.
- Most appropriate base images for Docker containers.
- Specific environment variable injection mechanisms for Action steps.

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard cloud-native and best-practice approaches.

## Canonical References

**Downstream agents MUST read these before planning or implementing.**

### Foundational
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — Project context and vision for SDLC Phase 6.
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — CIC-01, CIC-02, CIC-03, CIC-04 definitions.

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- `FileService.ts` / Workspace utility patterns: To be used when programmatically generating scaffolding files in the workspace (e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.
