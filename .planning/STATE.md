## Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-04-14 | Brownfield init — codebase mapped before new-project | Existing code detected; GSD best practice |
| 2026-04-14 | 14-phase roadmap covering full 9-SDLC | Each SDLC phase maps to a Angel phase; infrastructure phases bookend them |
| 2026-04-14 | Security persona as 8th debate agent | OWASP/GDPR caught at requirements stage = shift-left security |
| 2026-04-14 | Self-healing code gen via error-detect → re-gen loop | Eliminates manual fix-compile-retry cycle; max 3 retries prevents infinite loops |
| 2026-04-14 | GitHub integration priority for CI/CD | Repo detection + Actions scaffold = "zero to deployed" in one step |
| 2026-04-14 | Two modes: Conversational + Development | Conversational = always-on advisor; Development = triggered 9-phase pipeline |
| 2026-04-14 | Sprint auto-planner distributes by capacity | Fibonacci SP estimates + capacity input = realistic sprint distribution |
| 2026-04-14 | Quick wins front-loaded (Phases 1-4) | Security persona, GitHub integration, self-healing, sprint planner = highest FYP impact |
| 2026-04-14 | Use VSCode SecretStorage for all API keys | Extension API standard; eliminates plaintext credential risk |
| 2026-04-14 | MockLLMService for agent testing (Phase 13) | Existing DI supports it; deferred until providers are stable |
